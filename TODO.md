- put number of tasks into json spec under tasks.SomeTask - wait this would
  mean i'd have to cache tasks to be enqueued inside TaskManager.enqueue()
- ? how many jobids can i put into -hold_jid / -d
- ? can i use array jobs
    - some templating + job args in a file + line per task(?)
    - even easier just create a file with all the arguments per task - task-$ARRAY_INDEX.args
- ? how to make chunking work with array jobs??
- bootstrap function
    - git clone or rsync to src/ and create a submit there and just run it
    - repeatable
    - would introduce a project dir
- keep a db of submitted jobs - worth the mess? would allow restarts?
