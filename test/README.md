Tests
=====

Testing yatamana requires setting up all the HPC cluster in question.
Unfortunately, as of now i do not know of a simple way how to achieve this. The
`test_submit.py` is just a simple non-exhaustive smoke test that can be run on
our local clusters (one using SGE and the other using Slurm).
